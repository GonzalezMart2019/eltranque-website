  <h2>Judiciary Watch</h2>
  <p>
    We monitor Nicaragua’s judiciary to document political appointments, legal reforms, and patterns of
    institutional capture that undermine separation of powers. Our bulletin highlights key cases, shifts
    within the Supreme Court and other courts, and the legal tools being used to entrench authoritarianism.

  <h2>Diaspora Organization</h2>
  <p>
    Based in Miami, we organize members of the Nicaraguan diaspora around shared goals: protecting human
    rights, defending political prisoners, and building sustained pressure for democratic restoration.
    This includes public events, strategy sessions, and coordination with other diaspora hubs.

<section>
  <h2>International Advocacy</h2>
  <p>
    We engage with international organizations, human rights groups, and policymakers to ensure Nicaragua’s
    democratic crisis remains visible. Through statements, briefings, and coordinated campaigns, we amplify
    the voices of those inside Nicaragua who face direct repression.

  <h2>Research & Documentation</h2>
  <p>
    Over time, we aim to produce concise reports, timelines, and visual materials that document institutional
    changes, human rights violations, and the role of the diaspora. These resources are designed to be useful
    for journalists, advocates, and researchers.
