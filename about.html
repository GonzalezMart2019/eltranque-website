  <h2>Origins</h2>
  <p>
    El Tranque de Miami emerged from the 2018 Nicaraguan protests, taking its name from the roadblocks
    ("tranques") that symbolized citizen resistance and the vital Nicaraguan diaspora community in Miami.

  <h2>Mission</h2>
  <p>
    Our mission is to advocate for democratic restoration in Nicaragua through informed analysis, diaspora
    organization, and international awareness campaigns that highlight human rights and political freedoms.
  </p>
  <p>
    We track and analyze systemic challenges to Nicaragua's judiciary, documenting political appointments and
    advocating for constitutional reforms to restore separation of powers.

  <h2>Why a Monthly Bulletin?</h2>
  <p>
    Nicaragua’s political crisis is long-term, structural, and often underreported. The bulletin exists to give the
    diaspora and international allies a regular, evidence-based snapshot of how institutions are being captured,
    where resistance is emerging, and how people abroad can contribute strategically.
